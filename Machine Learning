How to correct loss in ML model
___


Various training methods to train a ML model
___
 1. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
    for kNN, there is no training step because there is no model to build. 
    Template matching & interpolation is all that is going on in kNN. 
    As no model is built, there is nothing to validate
    
 2. Logistic Regression
 3. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
 4. Decision Trees
 5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)


 What’s the trade-off between bias and variance?
 ___
 Variance is defined in Statistics, the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean
 Bias is the difference between the true label and our prediction.
